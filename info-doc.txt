Design Choices:
Clean and Minimalistic:

The overall design aims for a clean and minimalistic look to enhance user readability and focus on key pricing information.
Contrasting Colors:

The use of contrasting colors, such as a dark background for the header and footer, ensures a visually appealing and readable interface.
Flexbox for Layout:

Flexbox is utilized for the pricing options layout, providing a responsive and flexible structure that adapts well to various screen sizes.
Features Implementation:
Interactive Toggles:

Toggles are introduced for each pricing option, allowing users to switch between monthly and annual plans dynamically. This enhances user engagement and provides flexibility.
Currency Customization:

Although not explicitly implemented in this basic example, the structure allows for easy currency customization by updating the currency symbols in the prices.
Responsive Design:

The use of responsive design principles ensures that the pricing page is accessible and visually appealing across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
Challenges:
JavaScript Integration:

Integrating JavaScript for interactive toggles required careful consideration to ensure a smooth user experience. The challenge was to synchronize the toggle states with the displayed prices accurately.
Responsive Design Testing:

Ensuring the responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes required thorough testing. Adjustments were made to the CSS to handle varying dimensions without compromising the layout or readability.
Customization Extensibility:

While the basic structure allows for currency customization, extending the customization to include other elements (such as units) might require additional JavaScript and HTML modifications.
Future Improvements:
More Pricing Options:

Depending on the complexity of the pricing structure, incorporating additional pricing options may require adjustments to the layout and interaction design.
Enhanced Styling:

Further customization and styling can be applied to improve visual aesthetics and align the design with branding guidelines.
Accessibility Considerations:

Future iterations should focus on accessibility features to ensure the pricing page is usable by individuals with disabilities, including proper keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
